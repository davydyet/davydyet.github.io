            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Su — an IT engineering student currently juggling between coding and figuring out how to dress better. This website is honestly just me trying to put everything I’m learning in one place. I’ve been practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and worked on small projects like a SUM Club Management System, basic HTML pages, and some random animations on Lens Studio.</p>
            <p>Besides tech, I’ve recently started caring more about how I look (finally!). I’m learning about fashion — especially streetwear and vintage styles — and trying out skincare to keep my skin happy. It’s nothing fancy, but I’m enjoying the process of trying new things and slowly building my own style.</p>
            <p>This site is a little space where I can keep track of what I’m doing — from coding to fashion stuff. There’s also a fun quiz here because why not? Anyway, feel free to look around!</p>
